/**
 * Billing & Invoicing read models (docs/modules 04, 09 §62).
 *
 * These are presentational aggregates for the invoice register. The real
 * system builds them as read models over the transactional Module 04–05
 * tables — `invoices` + `invoice_lines` (frozen pricing snapshots, §14/§33) +
 * `payments` / `payment_allocations` (settlement, Module 05 §16). Until those
 * exist this is a frontend prototype over seeded mock data; the async facade
 * in `api.ts` is the seam where IPC-backed queries drop in.
 *
 * Amounts are in integer minor units (paise) on the read model (Module 04 §34).
 * `paidMinor` / `outstandingMinor` are derived from the allocations at build
 * time — never maintained by the UI.
